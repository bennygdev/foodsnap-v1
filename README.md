# Foodsnap v1
Made this project for a school project. This app is designed for food journaling, calorie tracking, and various other features (BMI Calculator, Calorie Calculator, Water Intake tracker, Recipe API Lookup and Location finder) to promote a healthy and active lifestyle. This is a huge project I've made in just 5 days before the project deadline, and it has drained me of my sanity. The files you are looking at now is a update of the project, with improved UI and UX and some extra other features. Well, the update was made in changes from the original version in training for WorldSkills. I am thinking of making a second version of this app, with much more improvements to this app and features I wanted to add, so hopefully I can complete it...
